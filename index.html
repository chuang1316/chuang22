				<p> My home town is Harrisburg, Pennsylvania but, I am Chinese. I grew up with two brothers Calvin and Colten. Some of my favorite things to do is playing video games, reading, and hanging out with my friends. Every summer I either go to China to visit some family or I go to New Orleans to just hang out. I was intrested in computer programming at a very young age because I wanted to help people and make better games.

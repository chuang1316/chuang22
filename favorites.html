				<p>One of my favorite things to do is hang out with my friends. We usually all hang out as a big group and go to the park. However most of the time we only really get to hang out at school. I also play video games quite often with a few of my friends. Some of these friends include William, Noah, Alyssah, and Abby. I hang out with William and Noah the most out of all my friends because they the only ones that even get on the ps4. I also like to hang out at Abby's house whenever I have the time(no mater what she says I'm better at ping pong and connect 4). Unfortuantly me and Alyssah only get to hang out at school because we don't have much time outside of school(She says she's cooler then me... don't listen to her). Now go visit XII_LUCID on youtube to help a brother out!(You're welcome William).
